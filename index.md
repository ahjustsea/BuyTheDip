BuyTheDip is a project made to help with crypto investing. It's purpose is to determine whether current prices are significantly/statistically lower (dips) or higher (peaks) than it has been in the last two weeks. Buying these dips and selling at these peaks will yield greater return on investment. Whether you sell or not is entirely up to you, but a portfolio that buys at dips will definitely outperform a scheduled-time-purchases (e.g., DCA).

1. Current cryptocurrency prices are fetched from coinmarketcap & coingecko API every 20 minutes. Z-scores are posted every hour unless when large dips/moons are happening, z > 2 or z < -2, the results are posted immediately. 
2. 24-hour trends in z-scores are posted three times a day: 11:30am, 7:30pm and 3:30am EST.

- **Level 1 favourless dip** = **Ketcup**. What the price (USD) would be if z-score dropped to **-1.
- **Level 2 good dip** = **Hummus**. What the price (USD) would be if z-score dropped to **-2**.
- **Level 3 great dip** = **Tzatziki**. What the price (USD) would be if z-score dropped to **-3**.
- **Level 4 exquisite dip** = **Guacamole**. What the price (USD) would be if z-score dropped to **-4**.

*Please be sensible towards calling Mole. In the best case scenario, Mole will slow down and crash. In the worst case, Mole will get banned from Twitter.*


## About z-scores

Z-scores for each cryptocurrencies are calculated from trading volume-adjusted two-week moving averages and standard deviations. 

1. Z-score greater than **+2** means that the current price is significantly **HIGHER** than what's expected from the last two weeks. In this case, *you may consider ***selling*** some coins to take some profits* assuming that your average cost per coin is lower than the current price. If you're looking to buy at z-score > 2, you will be paying a premium.

2. Z-score less than **-2** means that the current price is significantly **LOWER** than what's expected from the last two weeks. In this case, *you may consider ***buying*** more coins as it is a good time to buy*, and prices may go back to norm. 

3. Z-score between +2 and -2 means that the current price is very similar to the average price of last two weeks. In other words, the price is **fair**. 


## Does it work?

Yes, buying cryptos when z-scores are less than -2 or -3 can make you 6-20% additional returns on your investment. Detailed information on how BuyTheDip makes more on your investment can be found [here](https://ahjustsea.github.io/BuyTheDip/whythisworks)
