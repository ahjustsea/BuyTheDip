# BuyTheDip

BuyTheDip is a project made to help with crypto investing. 


Z-scores for each cryptocurrencies are calculated from trading volume-adjusted 14 day moving averages and standard deviations. 

1. Z-score > 2 means that the current price is significantly HIGHER than what's expected from the last 14 days. In this case, you may consider taking some profits.
2. Z-score < -2 means that the current price is significantly LOWER than what's expected from the last 14 days. In this case, you may consider buying more coins as it is a good time to buy, and prices may go back to norm. 
3. Z-score = 0 means that the current price is very similar to the average price of last 14 days.


Current cryptocurrency prices are fetched from coingecko API every 20 minutes. Z-scores are posted every hour, and trends in z-scores are posted every other hour. However, when large dips/moons are happening, z > 2 or z < -2, the results are posted immediately. More coins/tokens can be added on demand.
